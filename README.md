# Project Name


## Project Summary
We have been given the task to develop a e-commerce website for a small yet high priced vintage book vender. Although their selection is quite limited, it is important for them to host their shop in a well organized and appealing website that allows for clients to browse their collection, add to a cart, and checkout. In terms of the vendor side of things, we need to develop a vendor only page that requires them to be logged in, in order to be able to add new books to their shop.

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

- An e-commerce webpage that allows users to add items to a cart then allow those users to pay via Stripe. This application will allow users to filter by prices and the book's year of publication. Additionally, we will have a conditionally rendered page that exclusively allows a logged in vendor to upload a new item for their collection.
