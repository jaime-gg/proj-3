# TEXTOS ANTIGUOS 


## Project Summary
We have been given the task to develop a e-commerce website for a small yet high priced vintage book vender. They stand out as a local collector who has been in the book selling buisness for years, providing quality and certified content. Although their selection is quite limited, it is important for them to host their shop in a well organized and appealing website that allows for clients to browse their collection, add to a cart, and checkout.
